        <p>The module regarding HTML will help me in continuing to learn as it will prove to be beneficial whenever I need to create a website. For example, if I have been assigned to web developing, I can use the skills I have learned from HTML in order to do so. This biggest impact this had on me was the many challenges I have faced. Since this is a language I have never learned before it was very difficult to learn straight off the bat. I began to question the purpose of this but later on I realized everything was starting to click and I began to complete challenge after challenge for this module. This helped me face my challenges, making me a stronger person when it comes to code.</p>

      <p>The module regarding JS will help me in continuing to learn as it will be beneficial whenever I need to make a game, a website, etc. For example, if ever I need to create a game, I will have already learned some of the skills in order to create one because of everything I learned from JS. What impacted me the most was the object oriented coding part of the module. Over the course of my life I have hard coded everything but after learning object oriented coding it was very relieving knowing everything can be narrowed down. </p>

      <p>The module regarding natural simulations turned out to be very useful after realizing how to will assist me in my future learning. After learning about forces, vectors, and many more, this will help me further my knowledge and learn things more advanced. The biggest impact this module had for me was learning about PVector. After realizing that is an easier and more reliable method to plotting points, it was very relieving because it makes life much easier. </p>

      <p>Regarding the module Algorithms, it will be useful in future learning as it will prove to be beneficial whenever dealing with anything that relates to mathematics, especially since I have learned many skills from this module. The biggest impact this had was learning about binary search. The reason why is because it was very breathtaking realizing that there is a more efficient method in finding an item from a sorted list.</p>

      <p>All the 10 modules representing the certification for web design regarded HTML and CSS. You first learn the basics of HTML and CSS and later on take it to another level of advanced coding.
After learning how to web design it was very convenient to have gained knowledge about both CSS and JS, as now I can use the skills I have gained to further my learning. The biggest impact all these modules had on me was learning about CSS grid, reason being is because it helps keep everything organized and in a list, so it makes life much easier whenever I put information together. It also in fact makes a great template for creating a website as you could fit everybit of detail onto the grid.
